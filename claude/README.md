# Claude Desktop Integration

This directory contains tools and utilities specifically designed for Claude Desktop integration with DStudio. These components provide optimized views and structured information to help Claude better understand and work with the project.

## Updated Components

All components have been updated to use the standardized utility modules from the `/utils` directory for consistent error handling, file operations, and logging.

## Key Components

### Project Map Generator

The `project-map-generator.js` script creates a hierarchical view of the project with health indicators. It shows:

- Overall project structure
- Service health status
- Test coverage
- Component age
- Detected issues

Usage:
```bash
node claude/project-map-generator.js
```

Output: `claude/project-map.md`

### Code Map Generator

The `code-map-generator.js` script creates semantic code maps that visualize the structure and relationships in the code. It provides:

- Language analysis
- Semantic tagging of components
- Directory structure visualization
- Component relationship mapping
- Code element detection (controllers, models, routes, etc.)

Usage:
```bash
node claude/code-map-generator.js
```

Output: `claude/code-maps/*.md`

### Protocol Compressor

The `protocol-compressor.js` script generates hypercompressed protocol references with checksums for efficient reference during Claude conversations.

Usage:
```bash
node claude/protocol-compressor.js
```

Output: 
- `claude/protocol-refs.md` (Markdown format)
- `claude/protocol-refs.json` (JSON format)

### Claude View Generator

The `claude-view.js` script creates optimized views of project components for Claude Desktop, showing:

- File categorization
- Semantic grouping
- Tag-based organization
- File metadata with checksums

Usage:
```bash
node claude/claude-view.js
```

Output: `claude/views/`

## Sessions Directory

The `sessions` directory stores persistent Claude session information for continued context across multiple runs.

## Utility Integration

All scripts have been updated to use the standardized utility modules:

- **Error Handling**: Using `utils.error` for consistent error management
- **File Operations**: Using `utils.file` for safe file reading/writing
- **Path Management**: Using `utils.path` for cross-platform path handling
- **Logging**: Using `utils.logger` for consistent formatted output
- **Project Tools**: Using `utils.project` for service detection and management
- **Config Access**: Using `utils.config` for global configuration

## Usage with Claude Desktop

When using Claude Desktop, these tools provide structured information that helps Claude better understand the project. The generated files can be directly referenced in conversations with Claude.

Example reference commands:
- `@file project-map.md` - Show the current project structure
- `@service service-name` - Get details about a specific service
- `@code controller-name` - Find and explore a specific code component
- `Â§PROTOCOL_ID` - Reference a project protocol
