# DStudio Restructuring Summary

## Overview of Changes
We have restructured the DStudio project to clearly separate meta-information and infrastructure from the actual implementation code generated by the AI agent.

## Key Changes

### 1. Directory Structure
- Created `generated_implementation/` directory to contain all implementation code
- Kept meta infrastructure (scripts, docs, configs) in the root directory
- Added README.md to the implementation directory

### 2. Configuration
- Updated `.agent-config.json` to reference the implementation directory
- Added implementation-specific fields in configuration

### 3. Scripts
- Modified `gen-layout.js` to focus on the implementation directory
- Updated `gen-spec-index.js` to handle implementation-specific tags
- Enhanced `gen-status-quick.js` to track implementation-specific metrics

### 4. Documentation
- Added [IMPL] tags to specification requirements in `docs/spec.md`
- Updated `README.md` to explain the separation of concerns
- Enhanced `claude-protocol.md` with guidance on working with the separated structure
- Updated `project-status.md` to track implementation progress separately

### 5. Tagging System
- Implemented [IMPL] tagging in specification
- Added recognition of implementation-specific sections
- Enhanced reporting to handle implementation requirements separately

### 6. Meta/Implementation Boundary
- All scripts now enforce boundaries between meta and implementation
- File paths in implementation are prefixed with `generated_implementation/`
- Status reporting includes implementation-specific metrics

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Meta-level scripts and configs remain unchanged while implementation evolves
   - Implementation code is isolated in its own directory

2. **Enhanced Modularity**
   - Implementation can be swapped out without affecting meta infrastructure
   - Different language implementations can be generated without conflicts

3. **Improved Navigation**
   - Clear distinction between framework code and application code
   - Developers can focus on implementation without meta-level distractions

4. **Better Monitoring**
   - Implementation-specific metrics are tracked separately
   - Changes to implementation are clearly identified in reporting

## Next Steps

1. Run the scripts to generate baseline files for the new structure
2. Implement the first task in the implementation directory
3. Add language-specific scaffolding based on selected stack
4. Integrate CI/CD with the separated structure
