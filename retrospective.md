# Project Retrospective Log

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-26

## Iteration 0: Bootstrap (Date: 2025-04-26)
### What Went Well
- Initial setup of the AI Agent Bootstrap Package completed
- Directory structure and core files established
- Project specification defined with clear requirements
- Created separation between meta-infrastructure and implementation code
- Implemented [IMPL] tagging system for specification

### Challenges Encountered
- Needed to update configuration files to match the expected format
- Specification required expansion to include detailed requirements
- Modified scripts to work correctly with the separated implementation directory
- Ensured consistent tagging of implementation-specific requirements

### Lessons Learned
- The importance of comprehensive configuration for AI-assisted development
- Benefits of clear, structured requirements in the specification document
- Value of standardized protocols for development workflows
- Importance of separating meta-infrastructure from implementation code
- Use of tagging to clearly identify implementation components

### Initial Bootstrap Prompt
```text
Role: Autonomous Development Agent (Bootstrap Phase)

Objective: Initialize the project based on `docs/spec.md` and the bootstrap package.

**Bootstrap Sequence:**
1. Verify files: `docs/spec.md`, `.agent-config.json`, `scripts/`, `docs/protocol/`.
2. Run `node scripts/gen-spec-index.js`.
3. Run `node scripts/gen-layout.js`, `node scripts/gen-file-map.js`.
4. Update `project-status.md`, `metrics.md` with initial data.
5. Create `.agent-lock` and ensure `watchdog.sh` runs.
6. Commit with: `feat(bootstrap): initial project scaffold and agent package`.
7. Append this prompt to `retrospective.md`.
