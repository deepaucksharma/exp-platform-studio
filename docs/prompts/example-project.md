# TaskFlow: Cross-Platform Task Management Application

## Project Definition

TaskFlow will be a modern, cross-platform task management application designed for individuals and small teams. Using the DStudio architecture, we'll develop this application with:

1. **Cross-Platform Support**: Web, desktop (using Electron), and mobile (using React Native)
2. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Tasks sync across devices immediately
3. **Intelligent Prioritization**: ML-based task suggestions and prioritization
4. **Integration Capabilities**: Connect with popular tools and services

## Sample Specification Sections

Here's how sections of `docs/spec.md` would look:

```

## Project Plan Overview

The implementation would be structured in phases:

### Phase 1: Core Web Application
- Setup React frontend in `generated_implementation/frontend/`
- Create Express backend in `generated_implementation/backend/`
- Implement basic task CRUD functionality
- Establish CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Add real-time synchronization
- Implement views (list, kanban)
- Create analytics dashboard
- Add integrations with 3rd party services

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Expansion
- Adapt for Electron desktop app
- Develop React Native mobile version
- Implement offline capabilities
- Create synchronization service

## Technology Stack Recommendation

For the implementation layer, we recommend:

1. **Frontend**:
   - React with TypeScript
   - Chakra UI component library
   - Redux for state management
   - Jest and React Testing Library

2. **Backend**:
   - Node.js with Express
   - MongoDB for data storage
   - Socket.io for real-time features
   - JWT for authentication

3. **Cross-Platform**:
   - Electron for desktop
   - React Native for mobile
   - Shared business logic in TypeScript

## Implementation Structure

The `generated_implementation/` directory would be organized as:

```
generated_implementation/
├── frontend/                # React web application
│   ├── src/                 # Source code
│   ├── public/              # Static assets
