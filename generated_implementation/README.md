# DStudio Implementation

This directory contains the actual implementation code generated and managed by the AI agent. All code, configuration files, and assets related to the implementation should be placed in this directory.

## Structure

The implementation will be organized based on the selected language/stack. Common patterns include:

```
generated_implementation/
├── src/               # Source code
├── tests/             # Test files
├── config/            # Configuration files
├── docs/              # Implementation-specific documentation
└── [language-specific folders]
```

## Working with this Directory

- All build commands should be run from this directory
- Tests are executed against code in this directory
- Dependencies are managed within this directory
- Version control tracks changes to files in this directory

## Language Support

The implementation supports various languages:

- JavaScript/Node.js
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- Java

The actual language used will be determined based on project requirements.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow test-driven development principles
- Document all public APIs
- Keep code modular and maintainable
- Adhere to language-specific best practices
